# Notion Help Center Scraper and Chunker

This project scrapes the Notion Help Center knowledge base and chunks the content into smaller pieces for use in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

## Features

- Scrapes help articles from the Notion Help Center
- Extracts core text content from each article, including titles, notes, and paragraphs
- Splits articles into smaller chunks (approximately 750 characters each)
- Preserves context by keeping headers, paragraphs, and bulleted lists together
- Outputs an array of clean, formatted text chunks

## Output

The script generates a CSV file named `notion_help_chunks.csv` with the following columns:

- Chunk Number: A unique identifier for each chunk
- Content: The extracted and chunked text content from the Notion Help Center articles

## Sample Output
